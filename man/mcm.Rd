\title{Monte Carlo simulation of multinomial process}
\usage{
mcm(experiments = list(), n = 10000, algo = 1, NRUNIF = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{List of multinomial trials. Each
trial is codified as a vector with the number of results in each category.
The number and order of categories must be the same
in every experiment.
In a
\emph{binomial} experiment, this would be \code{c(number_of_successes,
  number_of_failures)}. The function also accepts a matrix (one column per
experiment).}

\item{n}{Number of simulations to run}

\item{algo}{Algorithm for pseudorandom matrix}
}
\value{
List of results, as described in \link{bernDist}
}
