Description: This package contains functions to compare multinomial trials under 
    the null hypothesis that each state has the same probability in every 
    experiment. In a multinomial trial, 
    the probability of each state is exptected to be the same in every measure. 
    This corresponds to random extraction of colored balls from an urn with 
    replacement. Each experiment would consist of a number of extractions. The 
    package offers a statistical test to ask whether the result is compatible 
    with the null hypothesis that the probability of extracting each color is 
    the same in all the experiments.
    The algorithm of mtest is similar to that of Barnard's test, but the 
    nuisance parameter is integrated over all possible values under the 
    null hypothesis.
